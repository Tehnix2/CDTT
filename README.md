Cooldown Tracker for Groups &amp; Raids on Ascensions' Bronzebeard Server


**CDTT Features**
- Cooldown Tracker for Groups and Raids
- Two different ways of tracking: Combat Log Mode or Addon Mode, adjustable at any time. Combat Log Mode is more performance heavy and is limited by combat log range, but allows tracking when other players do not have the addon (like in a pug). Addon Mode is more accurate, has unlimited range and less performance heavy, probably more suited for guild - groups.
- Tracked Spells can be configured and shown within 8 seperate category frames (A - H). These category frames can be resized and placed anywhere you want. You can also move tracked spells into a category of your choice to show them elsewhere.
- Tracked Spell Profile System which allows you to create different configuration for different activities.
- Spell Request functionality: Clicking on a cooldown bar sends a spell request to the player that casted this spell. Leftclick means you want that specific spell NOW, Rightclick means you want the spell in X seconds where X can be configured in the menu. The person that is receiving a spell request will get an ingame message, a countdown frame and also a raid frame overlay on the sending-player . Only tested with ascension default raidframes so far.

**Useage**
Type /cd to open the menu, turn combat log mode on or off, configure spells and their assigned categories, show tracker and place the category frames where you want. Fill with test data to see how it looks, then save position when you're happy and clear data. 

This is split - off functionality from another addon I will release in the future, now seperated into its own addon.

*Disclaimer: There are many weakauras that are doing pretty much the same, I'm just not much of a weakaura person and already had the code implemented into another addon, so it was easier for me to do this as an addon instead of a weakaura. If you prefer to use a weakaura for cooldown tracking, there is one on the Ascension Database: https://db.ascension.gg/?weakaura=1243.rev:1*
