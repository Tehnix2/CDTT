CDTT - v0.13

- Category frame width and heigth are no longer getting stored in saved variables.
- Added code to cleanup leftover width and heigth category frame values from older versions.
- Fixed an issue that made category frames not properly save their y - coordinate when that
  specific category frame had a scale different from 1.
- Added a button to delete saved profiles.
- When Combat Log Mode is enabled, you can now additionally also enable tracking group/raid 
  members only.
- Changed the READY text from cooldown bars to just R.
- Removed a couple old spell-request debug prints.
- Shortened the CCDT load message.
- Improved Addon performance.
- Added a bar customization panel, where bar texture, font, font size and color can be adjusted.
  These customizations should persist through reloads and logouts. This is experimental as of now.


CDTT - v0.12
- Combat Log Mode is now enabled by default.
- Added mouseover tooltip explaination to the combat log mode selector.
- Added two new slash commands: /cdreset resets all tracked spells to READY, /cdclear clears all
  currently shown spells.

  This tooltip is appended with CDTT information.

  various different kind of different tracked spell profiles. These are persistent through
  reloads and logouts.

CDTT - v0.11
Baseline Cooldown Tracking Addon with two seperate modes - combatlog - and addon - based tracking.
Tracked spells can be configured and shown within 8 seperate category frames (A - H).
Category frames can be positioned wherever the player feels like and can have variable sizes.
Clicking on a cooldown bar sends a spell request to the player who casted the cooldown spell.
Leftclick means you want this player to use the spell NOW, right click means you want the spell
in X seconds, where X can be set in the menu (/cd ingame). A spell request makes a frame appear
on the receiving players side, sends an ingame chat message to that player and also shows a 
raidframe overlay on the sending player for the receicing player. This is only tested with
ascensions' default raid frames for now.
